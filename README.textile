h1. About

#000000book ("blackbook") is an open repository for sharing and archiving motion captured graffiti tags. Tags are saved as digital text files known as GML (Graffiti Markup Language), which can be captured through freely available software such as "Graffiti Analysis":http://graffitianalysis.com (marker), "DustTag":http://graffitianalysis.com/iphone (iPhone), "EyeWriter":http://eyewriter.org (eye capture), "Laser Tag":http://graffitiresearchlab.com/?page_id=76 (laser).

Graffiti writers are invited to capture and share their own tags, and computer programmers are invited to create new applications and visualizations of the resulting data. The project aims to bring together two seemingly disparate communities that   share an interest hacking systems, whether found in code or in the city.
